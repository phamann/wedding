                    <p>And as we don't need homely gifts, we have another plan!</p>

                    <p>We know it's not traditional, and not the way it's done.</p>

                    <p>But rather than a wedding list, we'd love a bit of sun.</p>

                    <p>So if you would like to give a gift and send us on our way.</p>

                    <p>A donation to our honeymoon would really make our day.</p>

                <h2>Honeymoon</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>We are currently in talks with travel agents whom are helping
                    us plan our dream honeymoon, (as we had many destinations and
                    places we wanted to visit, therefore choosing as been hard).
                    Our current plan is to go travelling around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks or so
                    and then hopping over to the Maldives for a few days of luxury before
                    returning home.</p>

                <p> We are hoping to sort out a bank account soon where you can leave
                    donations - if you wish to do so -  or buy us holiday gift vouchers.
                    But this still being organised with the travel agent. This will
                    be up and running by April.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, we both love a surprise if you already have some in mind.</p>
