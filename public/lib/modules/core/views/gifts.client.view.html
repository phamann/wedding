                <p>We've been together quite a while, with all our pots and pans.</p>

                <p>And as we don't need homely gifts, we have another plan!</p>

                <p>We know it's not traditional, and not the way it's done.</p>

                <p>But rather than a wedding list, we'd love a bit of sun.</p>

                <p>So if you would like to give a gift and send us on our way.</p>

                <p>A donation to our honeymoon would really make our day.</p>
