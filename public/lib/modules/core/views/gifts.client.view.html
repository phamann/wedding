                <h2>Honeymoon</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>We are currently in talks with travel agents whom are helping
                    us plan our dream honeymoon, (as we had many destinations and
                    places we wanted to visit, therefore choosing as been hard).
                    Our current plan is to go travelling around Sri Lanka for 2 weeks or so
                    and then hopping over to the Maldives for a few days of luxury before
                    returning home.</p>

                    <p>We have set up a savings account if you would like to make a donation towards
                        our honeymoon. We will use this money to fund excursions, romantic meals
                        and cocktails in the sun. Please find the details of the account below.</p>

                    <p> Alternatively, we both love a surprise if you already have something in mind.</p>
