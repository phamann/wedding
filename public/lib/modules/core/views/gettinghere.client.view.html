                <p>For people whom donâ€™t want to drive on the day, we have
                    arranged a private bus to-and-from the venue leaving from
                    St.Helier Liberation bus station.</p>

                <p>The bus will be leaving promptly at 12:45pm arriving at the
                    venue for 1:30pm (allowing time for traffic). This will be
                    returning to the station after the days events at midnight.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, guests are advised to organise their own taxis
                    to take them to and from the wedding venue. These should
                    take roughly 30 minutes form anywhere on the island. A list
                    of local cab companies can be found below:</p>
