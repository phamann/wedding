                <h2>On the day</h2>
                <p>We would like the ceremony to start promptly at 2pm and therefore
                    ask you to allow a little extra time and arrive for 1:30pm at the
                    latest. There will be a chance for you to grab a refreshment and
                    soak up the beautiful scenery whilst you wait. </p>

                <p> A full wedding breakfast will be served directly after the ceremony. For which,
                    a menu will be on the website by the beginning of April including
                    the option to provide us with any dietary requirements you may have.
                    There will also be a hog roast and cheese board served later in the
                    evening for our evening guests and anyone still peckish. </p>

                <h2>Sunday</h2>
                <p>What better way to get rid of your hangover then a swim in the sea,
                    playing beach games and having a BBQ. Therefore, we would love for
                    you all to join us on the Sunday after the wedding at our favourite
                    beach St Ouens Bay from 2pm onwards. Meet on the beach between the
                    Watersplash and El Tico.</p>

                <p>During the summer season the Watersplash bar and restaurant has live
                    music playing outside in the evenings with a great atmosphere, so
                    we will most likely end up there after a day of fun on the beach.</p>

                <p>We will supply the BBQ and you bring whatever the meat or drinks you require.</p>
